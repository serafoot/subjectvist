# What is uncertainty?
--

<sup>1</sup>a situation in which something is not known. [Cambridge Dictionary]

---


# Type of uncertainty


--


.pull-left[
### Ontological view


Uncertainty is part of the world we observe.

### Epistemic view


Uncertainty is generated by our ignorance and limited knowledge.

 >Probability is the measure of uncertainty

# How do we "think"?

--

### Deductive reasoning

It is the foundation of logical reasoning, we start with assumptions/theory and we derive consequences using some form of "calculus".

--

> All men are mortal,  
> Socrates is a man 
>              => Therefore, Socrates is mortal

--

### Inductive reasoning

It is the process of going from a specific case to a general statement. 

--

> My neighbour told me that he  plays golf on Sunday
>             => Britons play golf on Sunday

--

#### we can use probability in both deductive and inductive reasoning
> but what is the meaning of a probability?

# What is Probability?


--

#### Frequentist Interpretation

The probability of an event is the limit of its relative fequency in an repetible experiment
> "The theory of probability can never lead to a definite statement concerning a single event." R Von Mises

--

#### Subjective Interpretation

The probability of an event/proposition is the __coherent__ personal belief of the event being true conditional on the state of knowledge 
> "Probability does not exist." B De Finetti

# The power of frequency

Probabilities as frequencies is a very appealing concept because:

- a frequency transform an abstract concept into a 'physical' measure

- it is embedded in our instinctive approach to assess the likelihood of events

but ...

- what do we do when we don't have frequencies? No frequency No probability.

- when we use inductive reasoning (i.e. data) is a frequentist interpretation our 'natural' way to think probabilities?

# Tour de France 2014 (from Wikipedia)

The 2014 Tour de France was the 101st edition of the race, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The 3,660.5-kilometre (2,274.5 mi) race included 21 stages, starting in Leeds, Yorkshire, United Kingdom, on 5 July and finishing on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 27 July. 

#### What is the probability of a British cyclist winning Tour de France 2014?

--

According to many observers before the race the top two favourites for the general classification were Chris Froome (Team Sky) and Alberto Contador (Tinkoff–Saxo).


#### Did this information changed your probability?

# The power of the subjective view

- Assume that probability is real (frequentist view). Then what can you say if I ask "what is a probability of tail with a coin that has two tails or two heads?"

- The subjective view stress the connection between probability and knowledge/information. 
--

- That's a very powerful concept. It allows as to think and compute probabilities of events already happened but for which we don't know the outcome.

### It is your ignorance that creates uncertainty (to you)!
