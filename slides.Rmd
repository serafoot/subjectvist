# What is uncertainty?
--

<sup>1</sup>a situation in which something is not known. [Cambridge Dictionary]

# Type of uncertainty

.pull-left[
### Ontological view


Uncertainty is part of the world we observe.

### Epistemic view


Uncertainty is generated by our ignorance and limited knowledge.

We already know that...

### Deductive reasoning

It is the foundation of logical reasoning, we start with assumptions/theory and we derive consequences using some form of "calculus".

> All men are mortal,  
> Socrates is a man 
>              => Therefore, Socrates is mortal

# What is Probability?


--

#### Frequentist Interpretation

The probability of an event is the limit of its relative fequency in an repetible experiment
> "The theory of probability can never lead to a definite statement concerning a single event." R Von Mises

--

#### Subjective Interpretation

The probability of an event/proposition is the __coherent__ personal belief of the event being true conditional on the state of knowldge 
> "Probability does not exist." B De Finetti

# The power of the subjective view

- Assume that probability is real (frequentist view). Then what can you say if I ask "what is a probability of tail with a coin that has two tails or two heads?"

- The subjective view stress the connection between probability and knowledge/information. 
--

- That's a very powerful concept. It allows as to think and compute probabilities of events already happened but for which we don't know the outcome.

### It is your ignorance that creates uncertainty (to you)!
