# What is uncertainty?
--

<sup>1</sup>a situation in which something is not known. [Cambridge Dictionary]

---


# Type of uncertainty


--


.pull-left[
### Ontological view


Uncertainty is part of the world we observe.

### Epistemic view


Uncertainty is generated by our ignorance and limited knowledge.

 >Probability is the measure of uncertainty

# How do we "think"?

--

### Deductive reasoning

It is the foundation of logical reasoning, we start with assumptions/theory and we derive consequences using some form of "calculus".

--

> All men are mortal,  
> Socrates is a man 
>              => Therefore, Socrates is mortal

--

### Inductive reasoning

It is the process of going from a specific case to a general statement. It is what we can broadly name: learning from evidence

--

> My neighbour told me that he  plays golf on Sunday
>             => Britons play golf on Sunday

#### we can use probability in both deductive and inductive reasoning
> but what is the meaning of a probability?

# What is Probability?


--

#### Frequentist Interpretation

The probability of an event is the limit of its relative frequency in an repeatable  experiment
> "The theory of probability can never lead to a definite statement concerning a single event." R Von Mises

--

#### Subjective Interpretation

The probability of an event/proposition is the __coherent__ personal belief of the event being true conditional on the state of knowledge 
> "Probability does not exist." B De Finetti

# The power of frequency

Probabilities as frequencies is a very appealing concept because:

- a frequency transform an abstract concept into a 'physical' measure

- it is embedded in our instinctive approach to assess the likelihood of events

but ...

- what do we do when we don't have frequencies? No frequency No probability.

- when we use inductive reasoning (i.e. data) is a frequentist interpretation our 'natural' way to think probabilities?

__Do you really need a frequency to have a probability__?

from Wikipedia:

The 1966 FIFA World Cup final was a football match played at Wembley Stadium in London on 30 July 1966 to determine the winner of the 1966 FIFA World Cup, the eighth FIFA World Cup. The match was contested by England and West Germany...

# Tour de France 2014 (from Wikipedia)

The 2014 Tour de France was the 101st edition of the race, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The 3,660.5-kilometre (2,274.5 mi) race included 21 stages, starting in Leeds, Yorkshire, United Kingdom, on 5 July and finishing on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 27 July. 

#### What is the probability of a British cyclist winning Tour de France 2014?

--
According to many observers before the race the top two favourites for the general classification were Chris Froome (Team Sky) and Alberto Contador (Tinkoff–Saxo).


#### Did this information changed your probability?

# The power of the subjective view


- The subjective view stress the connection between probability and knowledge/information. 

--
> That's a very powerful concept. 


--
It allows us to think and assess probabilities of:

1. events already happened but for which we don't know the outcome.

--
2. unique events.

--
3. when frequency contains to little information and we need to rely on our judgment.


--

### It is your "ignorance" that creates uncertainty (to you)!


---

# The objectivity smoke screen

A huge complain about subjective probability is its "subjectivity": if it is subjective then cannot be "scientific".

But that is probably a consequence of a negative meaning that we assign to something that is "subjective" as if it is arbitrary. 

But it is not.

First, you need coherence in your probability assessment.

Second, if you have the right incentives, you will try to use all the information and knowledge available to you to assess the probability as best as you can (even using a frequency if available). And you can use knowledge and information to explain your assessment.

Third, you need a mechanism to learn from evidence and improve your probabilities in a systematic and predictable way.

__Is a frequency really objective__?

# A deductive process example: tossing coins

## I am a frequentist:
I toss the coin 1000 times and I get 502 times tail and 498 times head $\implies$ The probability of tail is then 50% (0.5). What is the probability of obtaining 3 tails in 3 tosses: TTT

$$P(TTT| \theta = 0.5) = 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.125 $$

--
## I am a subjectivist:
I just watched on youtube a documentary on the Royal Mint showing all the fantastic technology they have to create balanced coins $\implies$ The probability of tail is then 50% (0.5). What is the probability of obtaining 3 tails in 3 tosses: TTT

$$P(TTT| \theta = 0.5) = 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.125 $$

---

# Frequentist inductive process 

I toss the coin 3 times getting TTT, what is the probability that the coin is balanced? $P(is_balanced | TTT)$

The frequentist computes

# Subjectivist inductive process
